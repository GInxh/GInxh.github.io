Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI. I concentrated in power electronics, and more recently did dev operations designing fault tolerant systems for data centers running large scale power grids for best in class production.    

I am now an SRE for a company providing a peer to peer network at the application layer, for decentralized applications for users hosting their own encrypted data in the cloud. 

If you would like a copy of my resume, or to work on a project with me, you can contact me
