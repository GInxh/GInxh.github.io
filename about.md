Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI. I concentrated in power electronics & electric power. After working for power & energy startups, I started designing fault tolerant systems, & detecting outlier behavior for data centers running electric power grids. 

After a healthy understanding of computing constraints on large scale data centers, I moved on to become a DevOps Engineer, specifically an infrastructure architect implementing kubernetes, & as an SRE using [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) stack in house.

I like kubernetes. I don't like the kubernetes security model, as it doesn't really exist by default. As a result, a large amount of my time and focus has gone into learning about low level monitoring, network security, & sandboxing. 

I now work as a Software Engineer for a security company making exploit detection agents, focusing on performance. tldr: I [chase memory](https://ginxh.io/2018-04-18/high-performance-priority-queues-and-ruby/) around alot, and try to make it better :)
