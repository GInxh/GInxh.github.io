Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI. I concentrated in power electronics, and more recently did dev operations designing fault tolerant systems for data centers running large scale power grids for best in class production.    

I am a DevOps Engineer with experience providing a peer to peer network at the application layer, for decentralized applications for users hosting their own encrypted data in the cloud. 

I like kubernetes. I don't like the kubernetes security model, as it doesn't really exist by default.  

If you would like a copy of my resume, or to work on a project with me, you can contact me
