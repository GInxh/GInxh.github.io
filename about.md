Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI. I concentrated in power electronics & electric power. After working for power & energy startups, I started designing fault tolerant systems, & detecting outlier behavior for data centers running electric power grids. 

After a healthy understanding of computing constraints on large scale data centers, I moved on to become a DevOps Engineer, specifically an infrastructure architect implementing kubernetes, & as an SRE using [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) stack in house. I took multiple kubernetes security trainings, and focused alot of new kubernetes security models and lower level monitoring tools for kubernetes nodes.

I now work as a Software Engineer for a security company making vulnerability & exploit detection agents, running in large scale devops environments, focusing on performance. tldr: I [chase memory](https://ginxh.io/2018-04-18/high-performance-priority-queues-and-ruby/) around alot, & try to make it better :)
