Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI, where I did a concentration in Electric Power. I currently work as an Electrical Power Engineer performing powerflow analytics on the electric powergrid. In my spare time, I like to [code](https://github.com/GInxh/).
