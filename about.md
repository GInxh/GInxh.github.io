Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI. 

I am the first dedicated SRE for a company providing a peer to peer network at the application layer, for decentralized applications for users hosting their own encrypted data in the cloud. 

I am currently developing cloud host agnostic testing tools to support user hosted nodes for a secure and optimized user experience, and first in class blockchain monitoring tools, with a focus
on decentralization for developing infrastructure as software. 

In my spare time, I like to [code](https://github.com/GInxh/), and take classes to also complete my Bachelors in Computer Science.  

If you would like a copy of my resume, or to work on a project with me, you can contact me
