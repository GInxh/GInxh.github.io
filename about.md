Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI. I currently work as an Electrical Power Enginee    r performing powerflow analytics on the electric powergrid.

In my spare time I like to  [code](https://github.com/GInxh/). Having some experience
in both Electric Power designing and constructing substations for renewable energy fa
rms, and working in power analysis for an ISO setting energy market designs, I now see there is alot of room for software improvement on the grid, so that is what most of the projects I work on in my spare time are related to. When I talk about some of my projects or things I am interested in, I will probably post them on this site.

If you would like a copy of my resume, or to work on a project with me, you can contact me:
