Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI. 

I am an SRE for a company providing a peer to peer network at the application layer, for decentralized applications for users hosting their own encrypted data in the cloud. 

I am currently developing scalable fleets of peer nodes to support user growth. I am also developing testing tools and microservices to support peer nodes and user hosted data stores, for a secure and optimized user experience, with a focus

on decentralization for developing infrastructure as software. 

In my spare time, I like to also like to [code](https://github.com/GInxh/), and take all the classes for a Computer Science degree. I am taking the classes from various institutions depending on which college offers the best course on said topic.    

If you would like a copy of my resume, or to work on a project with me, you can contact me
