Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI. I currently work as an Electrical Power Engineer performing powerflow analytics on the electric powergrid.

In my spare time I like to  [code](https://github.com/GInxh/). Having some experience
in Electric Power both designing and constructing substations for renewable energy farms, and working in power analysis for an ISO setting energy market designs while dispatching power in real time, I now see there is alot of room for software improvement on the grid, so that is what most of the projects I work on in my spare time are related to. 

If you would like a copy of my resume, or to work on a project with me, you can contact me
