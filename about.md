Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI. I concentrated in power electronics, and energy. After working for power and energy startups, I moved onto designing fault tolerant systems for data centers, detecting outlier behavior for realtime systems running electric power grids. 

Alot of people have asked me about what algorithms I worked with and what these solutions entail. I encourage you to explore [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/lecture-videos/) if you are curious about this kind of stuff.  

After a healthy understanding of computing constraints on large scale data centers, I moved on to become a DevOps Engineer, specifically an infrastructure architect implementing kubernetes clusters, and migrating applications into production on [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters and as an SRE using [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) stack in house, amongst a handful of other... dashboards.

I like kubernetes. I don't like the kubernetes security model, as it doesn't really exist by default. As a result, a large amount of my time and focus has gone into learning about low level monitoring, network security, and sandboxing. 

I now work as a Software Engineer for a security company making vulnerability detection agents for devops environments, focusing on performance. tldr: I [chase memory](https://ginxh.io/2018-04-18/high-performance-priority-queues-and-ruby/) around alot, and try to make it better :)
