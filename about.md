Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI, where I did a concentration in Electric Power. After working for a consultancy startup designing renewable energy farms,
I worked at the NYISO, designing and analyzing powerflow software for economic dispatch and energy pricing using machine learning with large sets of real time pricing data. 

Despite being on a team of Power Engineers, most of  my work focused on optimizing data center architecture to support big data queries for time series data, 
and building DevOps tools to respond and act on mission critical events on the power grid.

I am now the first dedicated SRE for a blockchain company that provides a platform for decentralized applications for using hosting their own encrypted data in the cloud. 

I am currently excited to spend more time learning and developing cloud host agnostic testing tools to support user hosted nodes for a secure and optimized user experience. 
On my own time, I'm learning a bit about hypervisors right now.

In my spare time, I like to [code](https://github.com/GInxh/), and take classes to also complete my Bachelors in Computer Science.  

If you would like a copy of my resume, or to work on a project with me, you can contact me
