Hi. My name is Virginia Hickox. 

I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from RPI, where I did a concentration in Electric Power. 

I currently work as an Electrical Power Engineer performing powerflow analytics on the electric powergrid.

In my spare time I like to [code](https://github.com/GInxh/). 

Having some experience, both designing and constructing substations for renewable energy farms, and working in power analysis for an ISO setting energy market designs while dispatching power in real time, I have noticed there is alot of room for software improvement on the grid, so that is what most of the projects I work on in my spare time are related to. 

If you would like a copy of my resume, or to work on a project with me, you can contact me
