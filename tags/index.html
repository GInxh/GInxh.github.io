 My favorite cheat sheets:

 [tmux](tmux.pdf)

 A cheatsheet I made for myself

 [linux root directory](bluelinux.pdf)

 I have made this linux root directory as an SVG in 6 different colour schemes
 including the google colour scheme and ubuntu default colorscheme. If you would like
 and SVG format before I host them online, email me and I can send one over.
